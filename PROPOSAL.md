My final project is going to be a calculus based application. 
In Calculus III, we learned a lot about vector fields and their various applications to the world. Often, students may 
find it difficult or tedious to draw out a vector field by hand. As a solution to this problem, my project will be a vector field grapher.
The user will be able to input a vector field function, and the application will draw the vector field. 
It is often interesting in calculus to see how a vector field actually affects a particle within the field. Therefore, 
my application will allow the user to send in a particle into the vector field, and the particle will move according to the field.

This project is largely inspired by my love for mathematics. The whole reason I majored in Math & CS was to see how I could 
merge higher mathematics with programming. As a result, this project will provide me with an opportunity to pursue this goal. 
Additionally, I will have a Calc III final coming up so working on this project will be an amazing tool for me to study for the final.
I'll have a better understanding of vector fields due to the active engagement with them. I'll also likely get better at 
visualizing vector fields which may prove useful in the future.

There are quite a few components to implement for the project. In the first week, I'd like to figure out how to draw the
graph axes onto the screen and take in user input through cinder. I think this is a reasonable goal because I would like 
the user to have the ability to change the axes if they want. For example, if they want the axes to go to 5 or 20 should 
be their choice. Also, I will have to figure out how to take in user input for both adjusting the axes and for taking in 
the vector field function. In the second week, I'd like to be able to draw the actual vector field based on the vector field function.
Finally, in the third week I'd like to be able to input a particle that moves based on the vector field. 

If I were to finish the project early I have a few stretch goals in mind. There are many other calculations that can be done using the vector field.
First, I could try to determine whether the vector field is conservative or not. Second, I could allow the user to draw a curve on the vector field. 
Then, I could calculate the work along the drawn curve. Finally, I could also implement a way for the user to use a scroll bar to change a component 
of the function in order to clearly see what affect each part of the function has on the field. There are likely more ideas I can come up with later, 
but these are just a few ideas that came to mind.
